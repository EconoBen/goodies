the zen of normcore
sometimes itâ€™s hardcore science,
but deep down in our heart,
we know that a for loop in a Python file,
can outperform the state of the art
all programs live in a system
forgetting this will make somebody sad.
this algorithm has the best metrics,
so why is everyone getting the same ad?
try to think about your tools,
try to limit your needs,
try not not to be the optimal model,
that was found by trying random seeds.
