Sometimes it's hardcore science,
but deep down in our heart,
we know that a for loop in Python,
can outperform the state-of-the-art.

All programs live in a system.
Forgetting this will make somebody sad.
This algorithm has the best metrics.
So why is everyone getting the same ad?
 
Don't worry too much about new libraries.
Simple tricks are here to stay.
Sometimes when you ignore a problem,
it will automatically go away. 

Try to think about your tools.
Try to limit your needs.
Try not not to be the optimal model,
that was found by trying random seeds.
